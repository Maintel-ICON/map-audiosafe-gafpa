    <h2>What is Audiosafe?</h2>
    <p>Audiosafe is a secure, cloud-based call recording storage solution provided by Maintel. It enables automatic export and archiving of call recordings and metadata from supported platforms like Genesys Cloud, ensuring regulatory compliance and long-term data retention.</p>

    <h2>Which platforms does Audiosafe support?</h2>
    <p>Audiosafe currently supports Genesys Cloud. Additional integrations with other platforms (such as Redbox) are on the roadmap.</p>

    <h2>How secure is the storage of call recordings?</h2>
    <p>Audiosafe prioritises security with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Encryption at rest (AWS S3 Managed Keys - SSE-S3)</li>
      <li>Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3)</li>
      <li>Audit logging of user access and activity</li>
      <li>Role-based access and Single Sign-On (SSO) using Microsoft Entra</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Is Audiosafe compliant with FCA and GDPR requirements?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Audiosafe is designed to support compliance with FCA regulations and GDPR. GDPR-related data deletion requests can be submitted via Maintel's support process.</p>

    <h2>Can I search and filter call recordings?</h2>
    <p>Yes, the Audiosafe user interface allows you to search recordings by:</p>
    <ul>

      <li>Contact</li>

    </ul>
    <p>Recordings can also be played back directly in the interface. Export and delete functions are planned for future releases.</p>

    <h2>What happens if we exceed our storage limit?</h2>
    <p>Storage capacity is capped according to your selected package (Basic, Standard, Advanced, or Custom).
